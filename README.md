# Go_task

### NOTE:
> In this task I have replaced the twitter search API with a public youtube posts search API.
> The reason for the change is that twitter had not accepted my application for a develepor account,
> and therefore I didn't have any access to twitter's search API. So I decided to find an alternative
> in order to finish the task on time.
> Attached below are the screenshots for the all the API's results as required.
